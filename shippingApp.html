Can you build me a shipping insurance app soall it will is you can add shipping insurence to all prducts and just say how much the shipping insurence will be / like we did no mof but i want an app to give to some of my friends

So you jsut sintall the app put in a shipping insurence price activat it and hit should then add shipping insurence automaticly to the card

Our: Price of shipping insurence will be added by the admin of the shopify App

yes price of shipping insurece should be editable for every store owner so he can decide what price to charge.how long you think this will take to do as it is very simple?

For every product I need to edit the shipping charges. 3-4 weeks

so how will it work if a new sotre installes the app you dont know the products.so this cant be the way to do it - just add by default the shipping insureance price to the card does not metter what product. 3-4 cant be more 1-2 days it is very very simple

Our: Here is the my understanding about the project ":- I need to make an app for shipping insurence. That will be different for each product and store.the price will be manageable by the admin of the appThe structure of the product will be almost same of each product page but in this I will show all the products on admin panel . We can't customize the admin panel of the shopify store.Also on cart page I will show you the whole price of shipping charges for ex it's $100There is details button in the bneath of price where customer can see the list of the product and their price 

no why should it be diffrent for every product. lik it is now on MOF it is always the same. you dont neet to do anthing with the products for now we sill just apply shipping insurence to all products with always the same amound that admin can decide how high it is.Shivani what are you talking about I just want it like you did it on MOF und OBLA exactly the sam function but just with an app so other peple can install int on ther store jurst say ok my shipping insurance cost is 3.99 and aktivate it and it will be applyed for all prducts in the card like it is now on MOF and OBLA no more

Our: no why should it be diffrent for every productmediabase aminsurance charges will apply on whole cart ? or for individual products on cart ?

lik it is now on cart. exactly same function - if you want to remove the insurence also have a pop up.... exactly same very simple function just in an app so everybody can istall. did you get all my points i think it is rely very simple simple app

Our: We can add checkbox on cart page.. where customers can add/remove insurance charges. we will create a product named Insurance and Admin can customise Price of product Insurance from App dashboard

the insurance has to be ther automaticly like i told you exactly as it is now. are you shivani or sobody else talking to me?

Our: exactly same function - if you want to remove the insurence also have a pop up.... exactly same very simple function just in an app so everybody can istall. yes, the insurance will be automatically there, In case if customer dont want insurance, then they can remove it by checkbox which i mentioned

yes like it is now right?

Our: We will add some code in Theme on App installation.. and we will provide some short-code which Admin can add that code in Cart page to make proper functionality. it will take around 3-4 weeks

why will it take so long it is so simple function?

because we need to work on theme, there are too many themes for shopify.. Official and unofficail theme. we need to make it compatible to all themes

i understand - so if it takes this long we have to wait for the projet i dont have budget to work on 2 projects lets do that later. thx
